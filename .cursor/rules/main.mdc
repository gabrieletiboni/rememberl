# My website for a workshop at a robotics conference (CORL)

You are an expert software developer in designing websites in pure HTML and CSS.
I need to design a catchy and professional website to attract researchers to my workshop proposal at this year's robotics conference CORL. I want the website to be very well designed, to stand out from other workshop websites.
The website is about the explicit use of past experience in robot learning, e.g. in-context learning, meta-learning, transduction ML, ...
You need to assist me in designing the website.


## Structure of my codebase
- `index.html`: main single-page website
- `css/`: folder with .css files
